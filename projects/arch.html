            Arch Linux - installing, booting and setting it up.

            At first, I was not aware of what Arch Linux is, because I was using Windows as my daily driver before.
            Until I heard that it is lightweight and fast. Well, I was just a thirteen-year-old kid back then, 
            and I didn't know what I was doing. So I fucked up.

            <br>
            <br>
            
            Anyway, what I really wanted was to learn more about Linux and how it works. I started with Ubuntu, then I tried other 
            distros like Fedora, Manjaro, and Pop!_OS, Kali Linux which my teacher said it is good in pentesing and hacking. I also tried 
            EndevourOS (arch based distro) but I still felt like I was missing something.. I'm like a lost dog and sometimes labeled as a WM 
            (Window Manager) hopper.

            <br>
            <br>

            Days passed, I was still searching for the perfect distro for me. My cycle was Linux > Windows > Linux > Windows > Linux. 
            Until I found out about Arch Linux, a distro that is known for its simplicity and flexibility. 
            
            <br>
            <br>
           

            I was intrigued by the idea of building my own system from scratch, so I decided to give it a try. I watched some videos on how to install it,
            read the Arch Wiki, and followed the installation guide. It was a bit challenging at first, but I was determined to make it work.
            After a few hours of trial and error, I finally managed to install Arch Linux on my laptop. I was so happy and proud of myself,
            I felt like I accomplished something big. I was finally able to customize my system the way I wanted it, and I learned a lot in the process. ( took me years lowl :p )
            <br>
            <br>

            As I started using Arch Linux, I realized that many people rice their desktops with it.
            I was amazed by the creativity and the variety of rices that people have made. I saw some really cool setups on Reddit, YouTube, and other platforms.
            I was inspired by the way people express themselves through their rices, and I wanted to try it myself.

            <br>
            <br>

            I started experimenting with different themes, icons, wallpapers, and configurations. I learned how to use tools like Polybar, Picom, and Rofi to enhance my desktop experience.
            I also joined the Arch Linux community on Reddit and Discord, where I met other users who shared their experiences and tips.

            <br>
            <br>

            I started to appreciate the power and flexibility of Arch Linux, and I felt like I was part of something bigger.
            I realized that Arch Linux is not just a distro, it's a way of life. It's a community of people who are passionate about Linux and open source software.
            It's a place where you can learn, share, and grow. I felt like I found my home in the world of it, and I was excited to explore more.
